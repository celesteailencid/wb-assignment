            <h2>The Benefits of Working with a Luxury Presence Agent</p>
                <h3>Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing
                    company.</h3>

        <div class="container-p">
            <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property
                to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to
                identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them
                via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who
                has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing
                capabilities the company offers. </p>
            <p id="bold">Here is how:</p>

                <h2>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
                <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time
                    online,
                    and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                    services are
                    able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and
                    YouTube
                    that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized
                    and
                    targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market
                    for a
                    property such as yours.</p>

                <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
                <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your
                    property. Being
                    able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that
                    elevates
                    the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According
                    to a
                    recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
                    video—and for
                    good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper
                    level and
                    build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing
                    viewers what
                    it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more
                    difficult
                    to do with a written description.
                    However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be
                    described
                    in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
                    created to
                    sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate
                    copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your
                    property
                    attractive to potential buyers.

                <h2>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                <p>Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet.
                    Many of
                    them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search
                    that
                    way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to
                    use the
                    right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as
                    search
                    engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms
                    is a bit
                    of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential
                    buyer
                    searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide
                    opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>

                <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
                <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands
                    of
                    niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs
                    to
                    dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury
                    real estate
                    marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent
                    spent
                    his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media
                    presence? At
                    Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to
                    help them
                    go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of
                    becoming an
                    influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than
                    their
                    competitors.</p>
